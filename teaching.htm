<h3> Undergraduate Courses</h3>
<body> 
Department of Mathematical and Industrial Engineering offers four versions of Probability and Statistics 
course for engineers. 
<br>
MTH 2302A: for Physical and Electrical Engineers.
<br>
MTH 2302B: for Chemical, Mechanical, and Material Engineers.
<br>
MTH 2302C: for Geology, Civil, and Mine Engineers.
<br>
MTH 2302D: for Industrial, Computer, and Software Engineers.
<br>
 I regularly teach <a href="http://www.polymtl.ca/etudes/cours/details.php?sigle=MTH2302D">MTH 2302D</a>. 

<h3> Graduate Course </h3>
I mounted a  Data Mining course <a href="http://www.polymtl.ca/etudes/cours/details.php?sigle=MTH6312">MTH 6312</a> after my arraival to Ecole Polytechnique.

<p>
MTH 6312 is a graduate course targeting Statistical Learning and Data Mining from methodological point of view. The official page of the course 
on the Polytechniques graduate course web list is 
<a href="http://www.polymtl.ca/etudes/cours/details.php?sigle=MTH6312">here</a>. 
If you had problems with taking the course, contact our graduate office at Ecole Polytechnique or send an email to vahid d0t partovinia at-sign polymtl d0t ca. 
 The course will be given every fall.
Lectures will appear at
one of the Ecole Polytechnique de Montreal's buldings. The teaching language is flexible (English or French) depending on participants.

<br>

The main reference books of the course are  
<br>
<li><a href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/978-0-387-84857-0#section=112965&amp;page=1">Elements of Statistical Learning, Data Mining, Inference and Prediction</a>. The book website is 
<a href="http://www-stat.stanford.edu/%7Etibs/ElemStatLearn/">here</a>. Download the book all in one
PDF from <a href="http://www-stat.stanford.edu/%7Ehastie/Papers/ESLII.pdf">here</a>.   </li>
<br>
<li> For students who do not have statistical background I suggest 
<a href="http://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4614-7138-7">An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R</a>. The book website is

 </li>
<br>
<li><a href="http://books.google.ca/books/about/Machine_Learning.html?id=NZP6AQAAQBAJ&redir_esc=y">Machine Learning: A Probabilistic Perspective</a>.   The book website is 
<a href="https://github.com/probml/pmtk3">here</a>. If you need more support check <a href="https://code.google.com/p/pmtksupport/">here</a>.
</li> 
<br>
All books are standard reference and best sellers in the domain of machine learning.
