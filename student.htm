<h3>You Are Admitted</h3>

<li>Here you find the list of the <a href="http://www.polymtl.ca/registrariat/faire/es.php" >OFFICIAL FORMS</a>, in .doc or .pdf. The graduate forms includes the English version of the form as well. The first form to fill after you register is your Study Plan (Plan d'etude).</li>

<br>

<li> In <a href="http://www.polymtl.ca/magi/coord_bottin/personnel.php" >BOTTIN</a> you find the list of all staff, technicians,  directors, professors, research associates, etc plus their phone number and their office number.</li>

<br>


<li><a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/polystat" >POLYSTAT LIST</a>
is a google mailing list where I distribute useful information tageting my graduate sudents. I suggest you to become a member of this google group with your google account. 
If you register without a google mail, you loose your access to the web history.
</li>



<br>


<li><a href="http://polystat.blogspot.ca" >POLYSTAT BLOG</a>
is a blog that my gradute studdents and I regularly write on. 
There, we try to practice our writing for amateur audiance.
</li>


<br>

<li> Our team meets regulary every week. The meeting includes If you subscribe in the google group you will receive the updates.
I expect that research students participate  </li>


<li>If you are PhD, be careful with your first year timing. You have maximum a year to pass 15 credits and then you must pass your qualifying exam 
in less than 4 semesters. Each year is 3 semesters: the fall, the winter, and the summer. Often no graduate course is offered during the summer.
You have to pass several obligatory workshops at polytechnique before your qualifying exam as well. Because of the tight timing, it is strongly recommended that you start your study in the fall. </li>

<br>


<li>As a graduate student you are supposed to participate in technical seminars as many as you can. In Montreal we have
many talks, workshops, and other means to learn for free and meet important scientific people in person. 
 <a href="http://www.crm.umontreal.ca/labs/stat/en/activites.html">CRM seminar</a>, 
<a href="http://www.math.mcgill.ca/node/5358">McGill's seminar</a>, 
and 
<a href="https://www.gerad.ca/en/events/type/seminar">GERAD seminar</a>, I suggest you to follow regularly. If you are using Google Calendar, you can add my events calendar directly to follow
 the updates by clicking <a href="https://www.google.com/calendar/render?cid=f464d3cul6nl55je5rmeq1qlbs@group.calendar.google.com">HERE</a>.</li>


<br>

<li>I suggest you to improve your academic writing, in English, before starting your thesis writing. 
Check some of these courses offered at <a href="http://doe.concordia.ca/english-second-language/esl-courses/">Concordia</a>. Such courses you can get out of program (meaning you 
only have to pass the course and your grade won't be counted in your GPA).</li>

<br>
<li> I suggest you to improve your French while you study at Poly if you are not French native. There are several courses that I suggest you to take  at UdeM  out of your program (meaning you 
only have to pass the course and your grade won't be counted in your GPA) in the following order , FRS 1211T (French conversation), FRS 1222T (French writing), FRS 1110 (French writing and conversation). Fore more information check the French course list at <a href="http://fep.umontreal.ca/formations/ecole-de-langues/francais-langue-seconde/liste-des-cours/">UdeM</a>. Be aware that you cannot register in  the course without a placement test, being taken early semester. Do not miss the placement test! 


<br>

<li>You have to learn at least R and Python programming languages. C and C++ coding is an advantage.</li>

<br>


<li>You need to work on Linux. I have a computing server <a href="cyrus.htm">CYRUS</a>
that you can run your long computing jobs there. This CentOS Linux server supports SSH and FTP services currently 
running over 32 parallel processors each with 2GB RAM. 
 </li>

<br>

 <li>You need to learn how to write readable codes.  See <a href="http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/Rguide.xml">R Style Guide</a>
 and <a href="https://code.google.com/p/soc/wiki/PythonStyleGuide">Python Style Guide</a> for instance.</li>

<h3>Supervised Theses</h3>

<li>Geoffroy Mouret (2014), No-Mean Clustering Algorithm [<a href="supervision/2014_GeoffroyMouret.pdf" >PDF</a>].<small>Geoffroy found a new extention of the famous k-means algorithm through Bayesian clustering.</small></li>

<br>

<li>Amir-Hosein Homaie-Shandizi (2014), Prediction of Pilot's Absence in an Airline Company [<a href="http://publications.polymtl.ca/1363/" >PDF</a>].<small>Amir produced a faster version of 
random forest to fit over large data sets. He implemented his algorithm in R and moreover developed a GUI through Shiny interface to apply his method as a management disruption tool. 
The airline company who ordered this project can reduce its costs by installing his software in order of million dollars every year. </small></li>
<br>

<li>Lafteris Samartzis (2005), Survival and Censored Data [<a href="supervision/2005_LafterisSamartzis.pdf" >PDF</a>].<small>Lafteris explored how one can improve a survival curve estimation through imputation of 
censored observations. </small></li>

<h3> Rules for Scientific Presentation</h3>
<li>Put yourself in the audiance shoes before making your presentation file. Always ask why somebody must sit and listen to you; come up with at least 3 reasons and emphasize on these reasons throughout your presentation.</li>
<li>Motivate your presentation with an interesting problem defined over real data.</li>
<li>Always use PDF presentation file. PPT files are platform dependent. Latexpresentation using powerdot package or beamer package is preferrable.</li>
<li>Make a title page with your name first, followed by your collaborators. Use the logo of research supports (companies) and the logo of your university.</li>
<li>Cut everything which is not directly related to the subject, even if you spent a lot of time of your research on it.</li>
<li>No more than 5 lines per slide.</li>
<li>Start with Graphs not formulas, not tables, not descriptions.</li>
<li>Manage presentation time and leave at some time for questions.</li>
<li>Balance your presentation for everybody. 1/3 for who do not have training in the domain, 1/3 for who have basic training, 1/3 for experts.</li>
<li>Any numerical result must come with standard errors.</li>
<li>Put page number in your presentation.</li>
<li>Spell check.</li>
<li>Do color management. Use high contrast colors, the video projector might be old. Think about color blind people: Blue-Orange-Green, not Blue-Red-Green.</li>
<li>Do not use tables with dimension more than 5X5, put graphs instead.</li>
<li>In tables highlight key digits with another color or in bold.</li>
<li>Write big enough on the black board, if questions are asked. </li>
<li>After answering a question, ask if you answered the audiance's questions properly.</li>
<li>Remeber the Bioemtrika parentheses steps ( [ { ( [ { ( ) } ] ) } ] ) in your formulas.</li>
