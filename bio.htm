<h3> Story </h3>
<p>Vahid Partovi Nia was born at Mashhad in the north-eastern part of Iran. <br>
After completing his bachelor degree, he obtained top ranks in three different fields of statistics independently, 
namely Mathematical Statistics, Biostatistics, Actuarial and Social Statistics. He achieved these ranks in the 
national competition among almost 2000 B.Sc. graduates of statistics and was 
exempted from the two-year national military service as a reward for this 
extraordinary scientific achievement. 
Vahid continued his master study in mathematical statistics to provide a 
good theoretical background, but his wish to develop methods in the area of applied statistics remained alive. 
He is basically interested in methodological problems inspired by applications.<br></p>

<p> Until now, he has developed a new classification and clustering method 
 for discriminating and grouping high-dimensional replicated data based on  
 spike-and-slab Bayesian model. He is interested in methodological, application and computational aspects of statistics.



<br> 
<p>He successfully held some part-time positions as university statistical consultant, experimental designer-analyst in the 
automobile industry and urban data analyst in municipality before starting his Ph.D. 
He won the Swiss Natinal Science Foundation's prospective researchers fund to 
develop his research ideas at McGill and then happily joined the department of Mathematics and Industrial Statistics of Ecole Polytechnique de Montreal.
